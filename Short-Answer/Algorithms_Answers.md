## Exercise I

a) The runtime of this code is O(n) which is linear. The reason is because n is being cubed in the parameter and squared in the the loop. Therefore it will take n amount of iterations because n is being added to the product of n * n. Ex: n = 2 will take two iterations, n = 16 will take 16 iterations.


b) The runtime of this code is O(n) + O(log(n)). The reason is because the for loop is iterative, and increasing linearly depending on the value provided. The while loop is multiplying j by 2 each time, therefore exponentially increasing j.


c) The runtime of this code is O(n). The reason is because the function is recursive and will be called the same number of times as the value of n. This is a linear runtime.
