#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime is O(n). The reason is because n is being cubed in the parameter, and a is being increased by the sum of n \* n each time the loop is run. In order for a to equal n cubed, the loop must be run the number of n times.

b) The runtime of this code is O(log(n)) because j is being squared each time the code is run, and each time is approaching the number n at a faster rate.

c) The runtime of this is O(n) because the function is being called n times. n is being decremented each time by 1.

## Exercise II

I would use binary search to find the floor that the number of dropped eggs is minimized. Because the floors should already be sorted, I could use binary search to determine which floor would have the least dropped eggs.
